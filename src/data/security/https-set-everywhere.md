HTTPS should be implemented not just on the login page as it is a prerequisite for a number of other technologies in security and performance. [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) allows you to easily and freely create and manage a certificate. Make sure your Cipher Suite is up to date and enable OCSP stapling on your web server. Test your page using [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/).
