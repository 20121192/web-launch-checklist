Responsive means that based on the width of the browser the CSS gives different style rules while all the resources stay the same. The most common change is a mobile drop-down menu. I use Chrome's device toolbar from within the Developer Tools as well as [Emmet Re:view](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/emmet-review/epejoicbhllgiimigokgjdoijnpaphdp) to test page view throughout development down to around 300px.
