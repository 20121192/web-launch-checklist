- Compress all your images using either web processors such as [Optimizilla.com](http://optimizilla.com/) and [Compressor.io](https://compressor.io/compress), or desktop apps such as [FileOptimizer](http://nikkhokkho.sourceforge.net/static.php?page=FileOptimizer) and [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac).
- Generate the exact image size for each element instead of resizing it with CSS/HTML as this can be a heavy process for the browser to perform.
- Utilize [Image Sprites](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Implementing_image_sprites_in_CSS) to save on HTTP requests and bandwidth.
